## SmartPhone: [iPhone SE Second Generation](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-se)

I wouldn't say I like a big phone, so for me, I think iPhone SE 2nd Gen it's a perfect size, and during Covid-19, I usually wear a mask when I go out and unlock my phone I don't have to take off my mask.
And second-generation Touch ID is a fixed button; I don't worry press it too many, and unlocking my phone is quicker than my iPhone 5S.

Then the camera, because I don't take photos at night very often and usually I would like to take pictures in daylight, so the camera it's not a big issue for me.

## Phone case: [RHINOSHIELD Mod NX](https://shop.rhinoshield.uk/shop/apple?device=iphone-se-2nd-generation&category=mod-nx)

I have the habit of using phone cases sometimes protect I dropped my phone by accident, and let me use my phone longer.

I used some phone case brands, but my personal favourite is RHINOSHIELD Mod NX; I like this modular design. I can change button colours or back pictures and transparent back. I can see through my iPhone back and protect my phone too.

## Earbuds: [Sony WF-1000XM4](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/truly-wireless/wf-1000xm4)

Bringing noise-cancellation earbuds with you can help you have a peaceful moment in different places. I used to wear my Sony WF-1000XM4 during my commute to the office and home or using in the office to help me focus on my tasks and things or listening podcast, news and music.

## Wallet

It just helps me store my cash, ID, driver licences, debit card and credit cards.

## Power Bank: [IDMIX CH07](http://www.idmix.com.cn/wap/index.php?ac=article&at=read&did=308)

It's a great Power Bank; it can be an AC charger to charge your electrical products and build-in USB C and Lighting cables, so you don't have to worry about forgetting your charging cable at home.

It almost can juice up my iPhone SE(2nd Gen) three times.

## Watch: [Apple Watch Series 5 44mm](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FWVF2B/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Series-5-GPS-44mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band)

I like my Apple Watch S5 even I have to charge it every day; it's a smartwatch that can help me records my activities and reminds my schedules, but it still has some cons, like recording my sleeping activities are not very precise for me usually you have bought some sleeping apps to help you.

I know Apple Watch S6 provides a Blood Oxygen Sensor, and you can use it to measure your Blood Oxygen, but I think only this upgrade is not worth charging.

## Watch Case: [RHINOSHIELD CrashGuard NX](https://shop.rhinoshield.uk/shop/apple?device=apple-watch&category=apple-watch&extraRimColor=black)

I used an Apple Watch case to prevent scratching my apple watch, and I can use it longer.
