## York Minster

The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, North Yorkshire, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe.

Some of the stained glass in York Minster dates back to the 12th century and much of the glass (white or coloured) came from Germany. The glass was painted, fired, then joined with lead strips (came) into the windows. The 77-foot (23 m) tall and 32-foot (9.8 m) wide Great East Window was created by John Thornton in the early 15th century; he was paid £66 for the work. This is the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the country, according to the Minster.
