## Hello 2022:

Today is the first day of 2022.

This world has changed a lot since Covid-19 for almost two years, and yesterday I saw many countries and cities celebrate New Year's Eve and had firework shows.

And I hope it's the final stage of Covid-19, and this world can go back to normal, and people cannot worry about this virus, meet their family or friends, and travel this world to explore their futures.

This year I hope I can find a QAE job in the UK and spend more time with my lover, go-to travel, go out for dinner and improve my English, finally I wish my family and my friends and I can be healthy and doing well this year and achieve their goals.

### Happy New Year 2022!!!
