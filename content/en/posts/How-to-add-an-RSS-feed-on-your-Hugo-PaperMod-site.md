Hugo is a popular static site generator, and PaperMod comes with a default RSS 2.0 template.

## What is an RSS feed?

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and itâ€™s is a simple, standardized content distribution method that can help you stay up-to-date with your favorite newscasts, blogs, websites, and social media channels.

Means supported an RSS feed function on your blog, can keep those who follow you up-to-date with your newest posts.

## Add an RSS feed on your Hugo PaperMod theme only three steps

### Step 1: Ensure `RSS` is listed as an `output` format inside your `config.yml` file

### Step 2: Add an RSS feed icon on your site

### Step 3: Enable full content support generated RSS XML file

So your `config.yml` file must include as below code:

```
params:
  ShowFullTextinRSS: true # Supports to show your whole contents in RSS, not just summary
  
  socialIcons:
    - name: rss # Shows an RSS feed icon on your site`
      url: "index.xml" # Your RSS feed url path

outputs:
    home:
        - HTML
        - RSS # Supports your site output including RSS format
        - JSON
```

**After finishing the above steps, now your Hugo PaperMod theme site can support an RSS feed.**
