[{"content":"What is Vim? Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as \u0026ldquo;vi\u0026rdquo; with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.\nVim is rock stable and is continuously being developed to become even better. Among its features are:\n persistent, multi-level undo tree extensive plugin system support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats powerful search and replace integrates with many tools  BASIC Vim modes Vim supports multiple modes. This section discusses some of the important modes which will be used on day-to-day basis.\nCommand mode This is the default mode in which Vim starts. We can enter editor commands in this mode. We can use variety of commands in this mode like copy, paste, delete, replace and many more. We’ll discuss these commands in later sections.\nInsert mode You can use this mode to enter/edit text. To switch from default command to insert mode press i key. It will show current mode in bottom left corner of editor.\nUse Escape key to switch back to command mode from this mode.\nWe can enter any text once we are in insert mode. Below image shows this.\nCommand line mode This mode is also used to enter commands. Commands in this mode starts with colon(:). For instance, in previous section quit command was entered in this mode. We can go to this mode either from command or insert mode.\n  To switch from command mode to this mode just type colon\n  To switch from insert mode to this mode press Escape and type colon\n  Visual mode In this mode we can visually select text and run commands on selected sections.\n  To switch from command mode to visual mode type v\n  To switch from any other mode to visual mode first switch back to command mode by pressing Escape, then type v to switch to visual mode\n  In below image bottom left corner shows visual mode.\nCreate new file Perform below steps to create and save new file −\n  Execute following command to open Vim\n$ vim\n  Type following command in Vim\n:edit message.txt\n  It will reload file if, it exist already\n  Switch to insert mode\ni\n  Enter some text\n  Switch back to command mode\nEsc\n  Save changes to file\n:w\n  Now message.txt file will be created.\n  Quit Vim\n:q\n  Open file in read-only mode Use –R option to open file in read-only mode\n`$ vim -R message.txt`\r Edit existing file Perform below steps to edit existing file −\n  Open file using Vim\n$ vim message.txt\n  Switch to insert mode and enter some text there.\ni\n  Quit editor without saving changes.\n:q!\n  OR\n  Save changes and quit editor using following command.\n:wq\n  Access help manual Help manual is shipped with Vim editor itself and it is really comprehensive. To access help execute below command\n:help\r Help on specific topic Help manual will show entire help about Vim. But what if, we are only interested in certain topic. Vim provides command for that as well with following syntax\n:help \u0026lt;topic-name\u0026gt;\r In above command replace \u0026lt;topic-name\u0026gt; with topic in which you are interested. Forinstance to access help about vim mode, execute following command\n:help modes\r Search help phrase in manual You can search specific topic only if you know its name. But what if, you don’t know the exact name of help topic. In that case you can use below command\n:helpgrep \u0026lt;phrase\u0026gt;\r For instance, to access help about navigation in Vim execute below command\n:helpgrep navigation\r Vim provides many commands which make editing functionality really powerful. In this chapter, we will discuss following items −\n Insert Append Open new line Substitute Change Replace Join  Insert text before cursor To insert text before cursor perform following steps −\n To insert text before cursor perform following steps Switch to insert mode i  Insert text at the beginning of line Let us suppose you are in the middle of line and you want to insert text at the beginning of current line then perform following steps\n Switch to command mode Esc Activate insert mode I  This action will move cursor to the beginning of current line and switch Vim in insert mode\nAppend text after cursor To append text after cursor perform following steps\n Switch to command mode and move cursor to appropriate position Esc Switch to insert mode a This action will move cursor next by one position and switch Vim in insert mode.  Append text at the end of line Let us suppose you are in the middle of line and you want to append text at the end of current line then perform following steps\n Switch to command mode Esc Switch to insert mode A  This action will move cursor to the end of line and switch Vim in insert mode\nOpen new line below cursor Let us suppose you are in the middle of line and you want to open new line below current line then perform following steps\n Switch to command mode Esc Switch to insert mode o This action will insert blank line below current line and switch Vim in insert mode  Open new line above cursor Let us suppose you are in the middle of line and you want to open new line above current line then perform following steps\nSwitch to command mode Esc Switch to insert mode o This action will insert blank line above current line and switch Vim in insert mode\nSubstitute text Let us suppose you want to substitute single character then perform following steps\n  Switch to command mode Esc\n  Move cursor to appropriate position\n  Switch to insert mode s This action will delete character under cursor and switch Vim in insert mode To substitute entire line use\ns This action will delete entire line and switch Vim in insert mode.\n  Change text Let us suppose you want to change text in current line then perform following steps\n Switch to command mode Esc Execute following command cc This is similar to substitute action using S  To change text from current cursor position, execute following command\nC\r This action will delete text after current cursor position and switch Vim in insert mode.\nReplace text To replace single character perform following steps\n  Switch to command mode Esc\n  Move cursor to appropriate position\n  Execute following command r\n  Enter character to be substituted. Note that this command will not switch Vim in insert mode\n  To replace entire line execute\nR\r Join text To join two lines perform following steps\n Switch to command mode Esc Move cursor to appropriate line Execute following command J  Basic navigation In basic navigation we can navigate to left, right, up and down by position. Below commands can be used for this\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 h Move cursor to left by one position   2 l Move cursor to right by one position   3 k Move cursor to upward direction by one line   4 j Move cursor to downward direction by one line    To perform multi-position navigation use number with these commands. For instance to navigate cursor 10 line below from current line, execute following command\n10j\r You can use numbers with remaining commands as well.\nIn addition to this, below commands also perform some useful navigation.\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 0 Move cursor to the beginning of current line   2 $ Move cursor to the end of current line   3 Ctrl + f Scroll down entire page   4 Ctrl + b Scroll up entire page    Navigate to lines Below command can be used to navigate to specific line −\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 :n Jump to the nth line   2 :0 Jump to the start of file   3 :$ Jump to the end of file    Word navigation We can use following commands for word navigation\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 w Move cursor to the beginning of the next word   2 e Move cursor to the end of the current word   3 b Move cursor to the beginning of the previous word    Using jumps Vim keeps track of your navigation using a jump list. You can go backward and forward through that list.\nThe jump list keeps tracks of all the places you’ve been to by tracking file name, line number and column number.\nTo view jump list execute following command\n:jumps\r Following command are based on jump list\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 Ctrl + o Jump back to the previous position   2 Ctrl + i Jump to the next position    ADVANCE We have seen basic editing earlier. Let us understand some other editing features of Vim. In this section, we will discuss following items\n Buffer Swap files Cut, copy, delete, paste actions Undo and redo actions  Buffer Buffer is temporary memory used by Vim. When we open a file in editor, Vim loads its contents from disk drive. These contents are stored in memory (RAM) whenever we edit a file we are actually editing file from buffer. Once we finish editing and save file that time only buffer contents are transferred to appropriate file.\nSwap Swap area is a file created by Vim to store buffer contents periodically. While editing file our changes may be lost because of any reasons and Vim provides swap files to provide data recovery.\nTo get actual name of swap file execute following command\n:swapname\r Cut, Copy and paste actions We often perform cut, copy and paste actions on text. Vim provides following commands to perform these actions (y stands for yank and p stands for paste action)\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 x Delete character from cursor position   2 X Delete previous character from cursor position   3 y Copy single character from cursor position   4 p Paste character after cursor position   5 P Paste character before cursor position    Multi-position command We can use cut, copy and paste commands with words and sentences as well. Below table shows this\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 dw Delete word from cursor position   2 D Delete entire line from cursor position   3 dd Delete entire line   4 Y Copies entire line   5 yy Copies entire line    To perform multi-line/multi-word actions just use numbers with command. You can use this syntax with other commands as well. For instance, to delete 3 words use\n3dw\r Undo We can undo single or multiple actions. To perform one time undo action execute\nu\r To perform multiple undo action, use number with same command. For instance, below command will undo last 3 actions\n3u\r In addition to this, to undo all execute following command\nU\r Redo Redo is apposite action of undo. Execute any of the command to perform redo action.\nCtrl + r\rOR\r: red\r Search related settings To perform incremental search execute following command\n:set incsearch\r To highlight search execute following command\n:set hlsearch\r To disable incremental and highlighted search execute following commands\n:set noincsearch\r:set nohlsearch\r Search in current file Search in forward direction Use following commands to perform search in forward direction −\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 /\u0026lt;expression\u0026gt; Search expression in forward direction   2 n Find next occurrence. This is same and find next   3 N Find previous occurrence. This is same as find previous   4 // Repeat previous forward search    Search in backward direction Use following commands to perform search in backward direction\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 ?\u0026lt;expression\u0026gt; Search expression in backward direction   2 n Find previous occurrence. This is same and find previous   3 N Find next occurrence. This is same as find next   4 ?? Repeat previous backward search    Search word under cursor Place cursor under any word and execute following commands to perform search operation\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 * Search next occurrence of current word   2 # Search previous occurrence of current word    Search in multiple files Using vimgrep command we can search \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt; in multiple files. For instance below command searches string - Jarvis in all text files.\n:vimgrep Jarvis *.txt\r Note that to go to next and previous occurrence we have to use following commands\n   Sr.No Command \u0026amp; Description     1 :cn Go to next occurrence of expression   2 :cN Go to previous occurrence of expression    References vim_quick_guide\n","permalink":"https://andrewwu29.github.io/2022/03/vim-note/","summary":"What is Vim?

What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have it be a clickable link, you can do this:\n\u0026lt;https://andrewwu29.github.io\u0026gt;\r Result\nhttps://andrewwu29.github.io\nTABLE Markdown table is a little bit complicated, and the layout is not too beautiful if you want to use it, and try not to make a large table.\n The outer pipe is not required. Left-aligned writing is to add : on the left side, such as :\u0026mdash;, similarly, right-aligned is to add a colon on the right \u0026mdash;: Center alignment is rendered by adding colons :\u0026ndash;: on both sides.  | Plugin | README |\r| ------ | ------ |\r| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |\r| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |\r| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |\r| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |\r| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |\r| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |\rCODE To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:\nUse the `printf()` function.\r``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``\rA single backtick in a code span: `` ` ``\rA backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` ``\r Result\nUse the printf() function.\nThere is a literal backtick (`) here.\nA single backtick in a code span: `\nA backtick-delimited string in a code span: `foo`\nCODE BLOCKS To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

Preface I recently had a thought to create my blog, and I used many blog services but ended up with nothing. And this time I made a decision, I want to write something, so after googling, I found \u0026ldquo;Hugo\u0026rdquo; this framework, you can use Markdown to create a static blog site. by the way, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend too much time creating a dynamic blog site to keep my thoughts and notes. For me this solution, you can use the free GitHub service to be your site host or pay some money to be a private repository and you can show your site too.\nIf you want to create your blog and you have budget concerns, you might consider using Hugo to deploy your blog site.\nPreparations First of all, we have to install Git to handle our stuff and deploy it to Git public repository, and then we need software to help us write Markdown files. (e.g.: Visual Studio Code with Markdown extension)\nGit install \u0026amp; check First, we can go to Git official site to Windows. Download for Windows follow your system bit to download a related version, that double clicks mouse left button, then press \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Install\u0026rdquo;, and you can finish the installation. After installation, we can use the Windows shortcuts \u0026ldquo;Win key + S key\u0026rdquo;, and type \u0026ldquo;CMD\u0026rdquo; to open Terminal. And then type command as below.\n git version\ryou can get it as below.\ngit version 2.xx.x.windows.x\rWhen we can query our git version, means we finished our git installation. And then we need to install Visual Studio Code, it\u0026rsquo;s a free IDE, and we have to install an extension to handle Markdown.\nVisual Studio Code \u0026amp; Markdown extension install Same we go to Visual Studio Code site to download the install file and start to install, same \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Install\u0026rdquo;. Installed and open it, you will see as below. Then we go to \u0026ldquo;View\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Extensions\u0026rdquo;(Also can use shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+X) to search \u0026ldquo;Markdown\u0026rdquo; Extensions, to find \u0026ldquo;markdownlint\u0026rdquo; and install it. Now, we have already installed Git \u0026amp; Visual Studio Code w/ markdownlint Extension.\nafter we have to install Hugo and create our blog\u0026rsquo;s first post.\nHugo install and create our site Before installing Hugo we have to install chocolatey this tool, here we use \u0026ldquo;Individual\u0026rdquo; with Administrative\u0026rsquo;s PowerShell and use the below command to install.\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\rInstalled chocolatey this tool, we can start to build our blog site.\nStep 1: Install Hugo We follow quick startedto install Hugo. This time we use the normal version, so follow the manual to use the below command to install it.\nchoco install hugo -confirm\rAfter installing Hugo, we have to check are we installed success, we can use the command below.\nhugo version\rStep 2: Create a site After we need to create our site, we will use yml format, so we use the command below.\nhugo new site \u0026lt;folder name\u0026gt; -f yml\rWhen you see as below, means created successfully. Step 3: Add Hugoe theme Finished Hugo site build, we have to add a theme for Hugo to make your site not look like too simple. We can go to Hugo Themes to pick up a theme for yourself.\nI will use PaperMod for this demo.\nFirst of all, we have to switch our path to our folder name, and we can go in terminal to type \u0026ldquo;CD \u0026rdquo;, and our created folder name is \u0026ldquo;its_demo_blog\u0026rdquo;, so we can type command as below.\ncd \u0026lt;Your folder name\u0026gt;\rThen we have to in this folder to create a new Git repo to use the command below.\ngit init\rThe result will like below. After we need to add our theme to our site folder to create \u0026ldquo;themes/PaperMod\u0026rdquo; under the root, we can use the command below.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod\rAfter we will see as below. Then we follow PaperMod\u0026rsquo;s Official Manual, to modify our config.yml.\nbaseURL: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;username.github.io\u0026gt;\u0026quot; #GitHub repo URL\rtitle: its demo blog #site title\rpaginate: 5\r# Default Language setting\rdefaultContentLanguage: zh-tw\r# Theme setting\rtheme: PaperMod #this time we use PaperMod\renableRobotsTXT: true\rbuildDrafts: false\rbuildFuture: false\rbuildExpired: false\r# GooleAnalytics servies\rgoogleAnalytics: UA-123-45\r# URL link setting\rpermalinks:\rposts: /:year/:month/:title/\rminify:\rdisableXML: true\rminifyOutput: true\rparams:\renv: production # to enable google analytics, opengraph, twitter-cards and schema.\rtitle: its demo blog\rdescription: \u0026quot;its demo blog description\u0026quot;\rkeywords: [Blog, Portfolio, PaperMod]\rauthor: Me\r# author: [\u0026quot;Me\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;You\u0026quot;] # multiple authors\rimages: [\u0026quot;\u0026lt;link or path of image for opengraph, twitter-cards\u0026gt;\u0026quot;]\rDateFormat: \u0026quot;January 2, 2006\u0026quot;\rdefaultTheme: auto # dark, light\rdisableThemeToggle: false\rShowReadingTime: true\rShowShareButtons: true\rShowPostNavLinks: true\rShowBreadCrumbs: true\rShowCodeCopyButtons: false\rdisableSpecial1stPost: false\rdisableScrollToTop: false\rcomments: false\rhidemeta: false\rhideSummary: false\rshowtoc: false\rtocopen: false\rassets:\r# disableHLJS: true # to disable highlight.js\r# disableFingerprinting: true\rfavicon: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;link / abs url\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rfavicon16x16: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;link / abs url\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rfavicon32x32: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;link / abs url\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rapple_touch_icon: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;link / abs url\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rsafari_pinned_tab: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;link / abs url\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rlabel:\rtext: \u0026quot;its demo blog\u0026quot;\r#icon: /apple-touch-icon.png\riconHeight: 35\r# profile-mode\rprofileMode:\renabled: false # needs to be explicitly set\rtitle: ExampleSite\rsubtitle: \u0026quot;This is subtitle\u0026quot;\rimageUrl: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;img location\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rimageWidth: 120\rimageHeight: 120\rimageTitle: my image\rbuttons:\r- name: Posts\rurl: posts\r- name: Tags\rurl: tags\r# home-info mode this time we use Home-info mode, also it's default setting\rhomeInfoParams:\rTitle: \u0026quot;Hi All \\U0001F44B\u0026quot;\rContent: Welcome to my blog.\r# You can put your social site links\rsocialIcons:\r- name: twitter\rurl: \u0026quot;https://twitter.com/\u0026quot;\r- name: stackoverflow\rurl: \u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com\u0026quot;\r- name: github\rurl: \u0026quot;https://github.com/\u0026quot;\ranalytics:\rgoogle:\rSiteVerificationTag: \u0026quot;XYZabc\u0026quot;\rbing:\rSiteVerificationTag: \u0026quot;XYZabc\u0026quot;\ryandex:\rSiteVerificationTag: \u0026quot;XYZabc\u0026quot;\rcover:\rhidden: true # hide everywhere but not in structured data\rhiddenInList: true # hide on list pages and home\rhiddenInSingle: true # hide on single page\r# someone can mention you edit a post\r#editPost:\r#URL: \u0026quot;https://github.com/\u0026lt;path_to_repo\u0026gt;/content\u0026quot;\r#Text: \u0026quot;Suggest Changes\u0026quot; # edit text\r#appendFilePath: true # to append file path to Edit link\r# for search\r# https://fusejs.io/api/options.html\rfuseOpts:\risCaseSensitive: false\rshouldSort: true\rlocation: 0\rdistance: 1000\rthreshold: 0.4\rminMatchCharLength: 0\rkeys: [\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;permalink\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;summary\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;content\u0026quot;]\rmenu:\rmain:\r- identifier: posts\rname: Posts\rurl: /posts/\rweight: 1\r- identifier: categories\rname: Categories\rurl: /categories/\rweight: 2\r- identifier: tags\rname: Tags\rurl: /tags/\rweight: 3\r#- identifier: search\r# name: Search\r# url: search\r# weight: 4\r#- identifier: about\r# name: About\r# url: about\r# weight: 5\r# Read: https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/FAQs#using-hugos-syntax-highlighter-chroma\r# pygmentsUseClasses: true\r# markup:\r# highlight:\r# # anchorLineNos: true\r# codeFences: true\r# guessSyntax: true\r# lineNos: true\r# style: monokai\rAfter we edited, we in our root folder to open a terminal and type hugo server -D, and then open our browser in search bar type http://localhost:1313/, then will see as the picture below. Step 4: Create a first post After that we need to create our first post, and we need to use a command as below.\nHere we use Hugo to create a new Markdown file under in posts folder, so you can change your Markdown file name to fit as your article name, but this time we use \u0026ldquo;hello_world.md\u0026rdquo; for teaching.\nhugo new posts/hello_world.md\rThen we open our Visual Studio Code to edit our first post, when we open \u0026ldquo;content/posts/hello_world.md\u0026rdquo;. You will see your screen likes below. We edited like below.\n---\rtitle: \u0026quot;Hello_World!\u0026quot;\rdate: 2022-01-06T14:00:09Z\rdraft: false\r# weight: 1\r# aliases: [\u0026quot;/AirTag\u0026quot;]\rtags: [\u0026quot;First post\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;]\rauthor: \u0026quot;Me\u0026quot;\r# author: [\u0026quot;Me\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;You\u0026quot;] # multiple authors\rshowToc: false\rTocOpen: false\rhidemeta: false\rcomments: true\r#description: \u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;\r#canonicalURL: \u0026quot;https://canonical.url/to/page\u0026quot;\rdisableHLJS: true # to disable highlightjs\rdisableShare: true\rdisableHLJS: false\rhideSummary: false\rsearchHidden: false\rShowReadingTime: true\rShowBreadCrumbs: true\rShowPostNavLinks: true\r#cover:\r# image: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;image path/url\u0026gt;\u0026quot; # image path/url\r# alt: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;alt text\u0026gt;\u0026quot; # alt text\r# caption: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;text\u0026gt;\u0026quot; # display caption under cover\r# relative: true # when using page bundles set this to true\r# hidden: true # only hide on current single page\r#editPost:\r# URL: \u0026quot;https://github.com/\u0026lt;path_to_repo\u0026gt;/content\u0026quot;\r# Text: \u0026quot;Suggest Changes\u0026quot; # edit text\r# appendFilePath: false # to append file path to Edit link\r---\r# Hello World!!!\rThis is my first post!\rStep 5: Open Hugo server Hugo local preview function, we only need to in Windows PowerShell or Terminal and in the site folder root, in command line to type hugo server -D, and we can in local to preview our sites, the initial URL is http://localhost:1313/.\nNow our site will like below. For now we already created a demo blog and posted our first post, and then we need to deploy to GitHub Pages.\nStep 6: Publish Hugo blog to GitHub First of all you have a GitHub account if you don\u0026rsquo;t have yet, you can googling and sign up. We need to in GitHub to create a repository to store our site and named \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io, the username is your GitHub username.\nPS: Because it\u0026rsquo;s a demo site, so the name is not following the rule. And then we need to in our main repository to create a new branch gh-pages, this branch is for display our blog site, and later we will use GitHub Action function to do automated deploy to create files to gh-pages.\n# Add all of files\rgit add .\r# Add commit message\rgit commit -m \u0026quot;init its demo blog\u0026quot;\r# Add main branch\rgit branch -M main\r# Add remote repo\rgit remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io.git\r# Upload site contents to remote repo\rgit push -u origin main\r# Add gh-pages orphan branch\rgit checkout --orphan gh-pages\r# Add a README.md\recho \u0026quot;gh-pages\u0026quot; \u0026gt; \u0026quot;README.md\u0026quot;\r# Add all of files\rgit add .\r# Add commit message\rgit commit -m \u0026quot;init gh-pages branch\u0026quot;\r# Upload site contents to remote repo\rgit push -u origin gh-pages\r# Switch branch to main\rgit checkout main\rRan down all of above commands, your repository will have two branches main and gh-pages.\nStep 7: Setting GitHub Action to achieve automated deploy We need to in main branch has changed to trigger automation to deploy to gh-pages.\nPreparations First time to This page to claim ours Token for next steps, we selected options as the below picture. Then to end of the page to press \u0026ldquo;Generate Token\u0026rdquo;, and copy the Token. After, we need to store your Hugo blog\u0026rsquo;s Token, the path: Repository \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Secret \u0026gt; New repository secret, like below picture, the Name you can named what you like, but the Value you have to set up as the Token we just got and press \u0026ldquo;Add Secret\u0026rdquo;. For now our preparation is done, then we have to set up our workflow.\nworkflow settings We will follow this Article\u0026rsquo;s workflow to set up GitHub Action.\nFirst we go to GitHub Action page and click \u0026ldquo;set up a workflow yourself -\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; Copy and paste the below code and do some modifications.\nname: Build GH-Pages #you can be named what you want\ron:\rpush:\rpaths-ignore:\r- 'images/**'\r- 'LICENSE'\r- 'README.md'\rbranches:\r- main\rworkflow_dispatch:\r# manual run\rjobs:\rdeploy:\rruns-on: ubuntu-latest\rsteps:\r- name: Git checkout\ruses: actions/checkout@v2\rwith:\rref: main\r- name: Get Theme\rrun: git submodule update --init --recursive\r- name: Update theme to Latest commit\rrun: git submodule update --remote --merge\r- name: Setup hugo\ruses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2\rwith:\rhugo-version: 'latest'\r- name: Build\rrun: hugo --buildDrafts --gc --verbose --minify\r- name: Deploy\ruses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\rwith:\rgithub_token: ${{ secrets.HUGO_DEPLOY_TOKEN }}\rpublish_dir: ./public\rcommit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}\rAfter modified, click the upper left angle button \u0026ldquo;Star commit\u0026rdquo; to store the workflow settings file, then you can go to your repository\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Action\u0026rdquo; page to see your process states. when the process state shows a green ticked, means deployed success. Step 8: Publish blog new posts When you finish the previous steps, you need to go to the Repository \u0026gt; Settings page to find \u0026ldquo;Pages\u0026rdquo; to change the \u0026ldquo;Source\u0026rdquo; branch to \u0026ldquo;gh-pages\u0026rdquo;, and you finish all of the steps.\nAfter when you want to publish a new post, only do:\n Use Visual Studio Code to open your blog folder. Create a new Markdown file at \u0026ldquo;content/posts\u0026rdquo; below and write your content. Then use git to upload the entire project file to your corresponding repository.  Finally It\u0026rsquo;s my first public tutorial! And I refer to lots of articles then finally I have this result, I hope this tutorial can help those who want to create their own blogs.\nReferences This post demo Site\nThis Git repo\n如何將Hugo部落格部署到Github上?\n代码笔记\nVisual Studio Code\nGit\nChocolatey\nPaperMod Demo Site\nhugo-PaperMod\nHugo 貼身打造個人部落格\nGolden Hat\n","permalink":"https://andrewwu29.github.io/2022/01/how-to-use-hugo-to-create-your-blog/","summary":"Step by step, teach you to create a static Blog, and deploy it to GitHub!
