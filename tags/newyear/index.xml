      <description>Hello 2022: Today is the first day of 2022.
This world has changed a lot since Covid-19 for almost two years, and yesterday I saw many countries and cities celebrate New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve and had firework shows.
And I hope it&amp;rsquo;s the final stage of Covid-19, and this world can go back to normal, and people cannot worry about this virus, meet their family or friends, and travel this world to explore their futures.</description>

<p>Today is the first day of 2022.</p>
<p>This world has changed a lot since Covid-19 for almost two years, and yesterday I saw many countries and cities celebrate New Year&rsquo;s Eve and had firework shows.</p>
<p>And I hope it&rsquo;s the final stage of Covid-19, and this world can go back to normal, and people cannot worry about this virus, meet their family or friends, and travel this world to explore their futures.</p>
<p>This year I hope I can find a QAE job in the UK and spend more time with my lover, go-to travel, go out for dinner and improve my English, finally I wish my family and my friends and I can be healthy and doing well this year and achieve their goals.</p>
<h3 id="happy-new-year-2022">Happy New Year 2022!!!</h3>
